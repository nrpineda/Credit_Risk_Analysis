# **Credit Risk Analysis**

### Overview of the Analysis

For this project we use data preparation, statistical reasoning, and machine learning we applied the machine learning to analyze credit card risk for a dataset from Lending Club. With the use of different libraries, we were able to create and obtain results with a variety of algorithms fed into each machine learning model.

We oversampled the data using the **RandomOverSampler** and **SMOTE** algorithms, and undersample the data using the **ClusterCentroids** algorithm. Then we used a combinational approach of over- and undersampling using the **SMOTEENN** algorithm. Next, we compared the two machine learning models that reduce bias, **BalanceRandomForestClassifier** and **EasyEnsembleClassifier**, to predict credit risk. (Module 18 Challenge)
